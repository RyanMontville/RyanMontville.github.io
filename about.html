            <p>I'm Ryan, but you probably already knew that since you found my website. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and went to school at The Ohio State University. I graduated in 2016 with a bachelors in Communication Technologies with a focus on human-computer interaction. In my free time I like bowling, hanging out with my dog Rufus, and trying new things.</p>

                <p>In 2015 I was accepted into the Disney College Program internship in Walt Disney World. I worked on 8 different different teams across
                    multiple lines of businesses including food & beverage, merchandise and attractions. Working for Disney was extremely enjoyable.I became friends with many new people from around the world, I learned many valuable skills, I got to take part in several once-in-a-lifetime events, and made countless unforgettable memories. Everyday brought new and unexpected situations, requiring me to make decisions on the go. Working closely with my team, I strived to keep our location efficient while still creating and delivering those magical experiences to thousands of guests every day.</p>
                    <p> When I first started the internship, I thought working for Disney would be a temporary thing and that I would go back to living in Ohio after the internship ended. I soon realized that I really enjoyed working for Disney and wanted to make a career out of it. I completed a second internship with Disney after I graduated in 2016, but I enjoyed working there so much, I ended up moving to Florida and working for Disney for the next 5 years.</p>
                    <p>When I started my first DCP, I started My Adventure Blog to talk about my experience at Disney. If you would like to read more about my time at Disney, <a href="https://ryanmontville.github.io/disney/">click here</a>.</p>

                <p>While working for Disney was enjoyable, I have always been interested in programming, especially
                    creating websites. I recently graduated from Tech Elevator's national live remote java bootcamp
                    where I learned how to develop dynamic web-based software systems using the Java programming
                    language and platform. Skills I have learned:
